## Pedagogy

[Inspired by the carpentries](https://orchid00.github.io/The_Carpentries_info/overview-of-carpentries-pedagogic-model.html)

-   Active learning (practice) is key, this course will have minimal components where I speak to you i.e. lecture. Instead, we will utilise 'live coding'.
    -   Live coding will show you my workflow, my mistakes (everyone makes them) and how I troubleshoot them!
    -   When you run into difficulty utilise the chat in class, communicating with others is key to understanding
    -   Spaced retrieval
    -   Managed cognitive load

## Assessments

These will be made available as we get closer to the time, more information on moodle.

-   1: Basic Data Analysis, due 3/4/23
-   2: Visualisation, due 17/5/23
-   3: Online Timed Assessment, 48 hours 9/6/23 - 11/6/23
-   4: Data retrieval and modelling, due 22/6/23

## How to find help?

-   Collaboration forum (moodle)
-   The chat during lectures (on wednesday ask your peers, on Michael will be in the chat)
