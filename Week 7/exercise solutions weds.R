# 2 homework (h/w)

# 1 Create one plot on the fuel economy data with customized title,
  # subtitle, caption, x, y, and color labels.

?mpg
mpg$class |> unique()

mpg |> 
  ggplot(aes(cty, hwy, colour = class)) +

         x = "city fuel use",
         y = "highway fuel use",
         colour = "Car type")

# 2. Recreate the following plot using the fuel economy data. Note that both
#   the colors and shapes of points vary by type of drive train.

# 2 class
# 3 breakout (b/o)
# 4 b/o
# 5 b/o

# 1. Use geom_text() with infinite positions to place text at the four
#   corners of the plot.
 


# 2. Use annotate() to add a point geom in the middle of your last plot
#   without having to create a tibble. Customize the shape, size, or color of
#   the point.

  annotate(
    geom = "text", x = 22.5, y = 22.5, label = "middle of the road", size = 30, colour = "green")
 
# 3. How do labels with geom_text() interact with faceting? How can you
#   add a label to a single facet? How can you put a different label in each
#   facet? (Hint: Think about the underlying data.)

# both horizontal line and the label is added within each facet rather than over the top of them all 

# 4. What arguments to geom_label() control the appearance of the
#   background box?

?geom_label
# label.padding controls the amount of padding around the label.
# label.size controls the size of the label border in mm


# 5. What are the four arguments to arrow()? How do they work? Create a
#   series of plots that demonstrate the most important options.
?arrow
?grid::arrow()


# angle	
# The angle of the arrow head in degrees (smaller numbers produce narrower, pointier arrows). Essentially describes the width of the arrow head.

# length	
# A unit specifying the length of the arrow head (from tip to base).
 
# ends	
# One of "last", "first", or "both", indicating which ends of the line to draw arrow heads.
 
# type	
# One of "open" or "closed" indicating whether the arrow head should be a closed triangle.

# type

# 1. Why doesnâ€™t the following code override the default scale?
df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = rnorm(10000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  coord_fixed()

# geom_hex uses a fill, not a colour. Therefore changing code to reflect this means it will run

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  coord_fixed()

# 2. What is the first argument to every scale? How does it compare to
#   labs()?

# 3. Change the display of the presidential terms by:
#   a. Combining the two variants shown above.
#   b. Improving the display of the y axis.
#   c. Labelling each term with the name of the president.
#   d. Adding informative plot labels.
#   e. Placing breaks every 4 years (this is trickier than it seems!).
